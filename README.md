### Motivation

Moving from Texas to Colorado I had a rude awakening when it came to gettng my queso fix.  Turns out it is not as much of a "thing" as it is in Texas. Having trouble finding restaurants with a quality product, I decided to create a web application to rate and provide links to find quesos around the city of Denver.

### Code Example

```    const displayPrice = () => {
        if ((queso.price) <= 5){
            return  "ðŸ¤‘"
        }else if ((queso.price) >= 6 && (queso.price) <= 9){
            return "ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘"
        }else if ((queso.price) >= 10){
            return  "ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘"}
    }
    const displaySpicy = () => {
        if ((queso.spicy) <= 3){
            return  "ðŸ”¥"
        }else if ((queso.spicy) >= 4 && (queso.spicy) <= 6){
            return "ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥"
        }else if ((queso.spicy) >= 7){
            return  "ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥"}
    }
```
