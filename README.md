# Project Title

303 QuesoFinder

## Description

SPA designed to showcase, rate, and point people in the direction of Denverâ€™s best queso with links to each on google maps

### Motivation

Moving from Texas to Colorado I had a rude awakening when it came to gettng my queso fix.  Turns out it is not as much of a "thing" as it is in Texas. Having trouble finding restaurants with a quality product, I decided to create a web application to rate and provide links to find quesos around the city of Denver.
